Hello World
===========

First of all we are just going to create a file called ``hello.uv`` with the following code.

.. code-block::
	:linenos:

	import "print.uv";

	fn main(): int {
		println("Hello World!");

		return 0;
	}

Once we have that, simply run the command:

.. code-block:: bash

  uvc hello.uv

Then you should see the output

.. code-block::

	Hello World!


What just went on
-----------------

Line 1, we imported ``print.uv``, as there is no such file defined in the local directly,
``uvc`` instead imported the file from the standard library.
That file then defined ``println`` amongst other functions for us to use.

Lines 3, is us defining the starting point for our program, ``fn`` denoting this is a function,
``main`` tells the compiler this is the entry point, the function itself takes no inputs, hence the ``()`` -
then finally there is ``: int`` which tells the compiler this function returns an integer.

.. note::
	Why return an integer? It allows the operating system to know if our program executed successfully.
	If a program returns ``0``, then the OS knows the program finished successfully, if it returns any other value
	(typically ``1``) then the operating system knows the program failed.

Line 4, we parsed the constant value ``Hello World`` to the function ``println``, which then sent the input to the standard output of the system.
Hence why we saw it.

Finally line 5, we return ``0``, as our program executed successfully.
